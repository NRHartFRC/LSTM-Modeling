# LSTM-Modeling
Attempt to predict the underlying price for the following day with Long Short Term Memory modeling. This method uses Keras sequential API for deep learning applications (pat of TensorFlow APIs). This program determines a target and date range, trains a model using a neural network, then outputs both a plot and the predicted output price for the following day.
